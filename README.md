#An Analysis of Kickstarter Trends

##Overview

	The purpose of this analysis is to determine the most favorable conditions for achieving a successful Kickstarter campaign.
From among a wide array of different Kickstarter campaigns, we have chosen to focus on theatrical plays as they are most relevant to Louise's campaign.


##Analysis and Challenges

	By utilizing pivot data on Theater outcomes, we have determined a correlation between launch month and success rate.

##Results

###Outcomes by Month

	One of the most noticeable trends of the data is that the majority of successful campaigns begin in late spring and early summer.
The above screenshots highlight the success of campaigns that begin in April through July - with May launches being the most successful of all.

Additionally, the data illustrates the failure of productions that begin during the fall and winter months.  In particular, the month of December seems to have the lowest success rates.  While October boasts slightly higher success rates than the 
other fall/winter months, it also has a correspondingly higher failure rate.  Essentially, the most successful campaigns begin in May with the least successful beginning in December.
